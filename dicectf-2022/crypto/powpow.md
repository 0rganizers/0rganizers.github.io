## Solution

The challenge presents us with a verifiable delay function (VDF), which (if correctly implemented) requires us to compute

$$
h \equiv g^{2^T} \pmod n.
$$

This requires us to perform $T = 2^{64}$ squares of $g \pmod n$, which is totally infeasible for a weekend CTF! If we could factor $n$, we could first compute $a \equiv 2^T \pmod{\phi(n)}$, but as the challenge is set up, it's obvious we can't factor the 2048 bit modulus.

Another option would be to pick a generator $g$ of low order, for the RSA group $\mathcal{G} = (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*$, two easy options are $g=1$ or $g=-1$. However, looking at `verify(g,h,pi)`, we see that these elements are explicitly excluded from being considered

```python
def is_valid(x):
    return type(x) == int and 0 < x < n

def verify(g, h, pi):
    assert is_valid(g)
    assert is_valid(h)
    assert is_valid(pi)
    assert g != 1 and g != n - 1
    m = H(g, h)
    r = pow(2, T, m)
    assert h == pow(pi, m, n) * pow(g, r, n) % n
```

 First `is_valid(x)` ensures that $g,h,\pi \in \mathcal{G}$ and then the additional check `assert g != 1 and g != n - 1` ensures that $g$ has unknown order. 

So if we can't run `prove(g)` in a reasonable amount of time, and we can't cheat the VDF by factoring, or selecting an element of known order, then there must be something within `verify` we can cheat.

First, let's look at what appears in `verify(g,h,pi)` and what we have control over. 

We choose as input any $g,h,\pi \in \mathcal{G}$ and from $g,h$ `shake128` is used as a pseudorandom function to generate $m$. Finally, from $m$ we find $r \equiv 2^T \pmod m$. 

To pass the test in verify, naively we need to send integers from the output of `h, pi = prove(g)` such that the following congruence holds:

$$
h \equiv g^r \cdot \pi^m \pmod n.
$$

Although this congruence assumes the input $(g,h,\pi)$ have the relationship established by `prove(g)`, what if we instead view this as a general congruence? Let's try by assuming all variables can be expressed as a power of a generator $b$ and attempt to forget about `prove(g)` altogether! For our implementation, we make the choice $b = 2$, but this is arbitary.

$$
g \equiv b^M \pmod n, \quad h \equiv b^A \pmod n, \quad \pi \equiv b^B \pmod n.
$$

From this point of view, we need to try and find integers $(M,A,B)$ such that

$$
b^A \equiv b^{rM} \cdot b^{mB} \pmod n \Leftarrow A = rM + mB
$$

The integers $(m,r)$ are generated from

```python
def H(g, h):
    return int.from_bytes(shake_128(encode(g) + encode(h)).digest(16), 'big')

# We can pick these
M, A, B = ?, ?, ?
g = pow(2,M,n)
h = pow(2,A,n)
pi = pow(2,B,n)

# Effectively random
m = H(g, h)
r = pow(2, T, m)
```

and we can effectively treat these integers as totally random. More importantly, the values are unknown until we make a choice for both $g,h$ (and therefore $M,A$). 

Our first simplification will be $A = 0 \Rightarrow h = 1$, which simplifies our equation and is a valid input for $h$. Now we need to pick $(M,B)$ such that

$$
0 = rM + mB,
$$

where we remember that the values of $(r,m)$ are only known after selecting $M$, but $B$ can be set afterwards. It then makes sense to rearrange the above equation into the form:

$$
B = -\frac{rM}{m}
$$

To find an integer solution $B$, we then need to find some $rM$ which is divisible by a random integer $m$. 

The VDF function which appears in the challenge is based off work by [Wesolowski](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/623), reviewed in a paper by [Boneh, Bünz and Fisch](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/712.pdf). There is a key difference though between the paper and the challenge. In Wesolowski's work, $m$ is prime, and finding a $M$ divisible by some large, random prime is computationally hard. The challenge becomes solvable because $m$ is totally random and so can be composite. 

To find an integer $M \equiv 0 \pmod m$, the best chance we have is to use some very smooth integer, such as $M = n!$, or $M = \prod_i^n p_i$ as the product of the first $n$ primes. In the challenge author's [write-up](https://priv.pub/posts/dicectf-2022), they pick

$$
M = 256! \prod_i^n p_i,
$$

where they consider all primes $p_i < 10^{20}$. Including $256!$ allows for repeated small factors in $m$. In our solution, we find it is enough to simply take the product of all primes below $10^6$.

To then solve the congruence, we first generate a very smooth integer $M$ and set $g \equiv b^M \pmod n$. From this, we compute $m = H(g,1)$. If $M \equiv 0 \pmod m$ we break the loop, compute $r$ from $m$, then $B(M,r,m)$. Finally setting $\pi \equiv b^B \pmod n$ for our solution $(g,h,\pi)$. If the congruence doesn't hold, we square $g \equiv g^2 \pmod n$ and double $M = 2M$ for bookkeeping, and try again.

Sending our specially crafted $(g,h,\pi) = (g,1,\pi)$ to the server, we get the flag.

## Implementation

**Note:** We use `gmpy2` to speed up all the modular maths we need to do, but you can do this using python's `int` type and solve in a reasonable amount of time.

```python
from gmpy2 import mpz, is_prime
from hashlib import shake_128
